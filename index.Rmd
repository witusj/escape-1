# Introduction

This document is dedicated to my uncle Stanisław Czernicki.
```{r , echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Dyrektor Stanislaw Czernicki.', out.width='40%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("Images/Czernicki.jpg", 1))
```

Once, I stumbled upon a Polish book in someone's bookcase: ‘*Stories from teachers*’. The first chapter was written by Stanisław. He is the brother of my grand-mother. I never got to know him in person, but I heard stories about him. This story tells about his escape from the concentration camp. This project is to translate the story from Polish to English, and to do a background research on the mentioned names.
